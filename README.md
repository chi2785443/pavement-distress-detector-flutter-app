Sure, Chinedu! Here's a professional and comprehensive `README.md` for your **Pavement Distress Detector App**, based on everything we've worked on:

---

## 🛣️ Pavement Distress Detector App

An AI-powered mobile application built with **React Native / Flutter**, integrated with **TensorFlow Lite**, **FastAPI**, and **Google Maps SDK**, designed to detect pavement cracks/distresses in real-time using camera input.

---

### 🚀 Features

- 📸 **Live Camera Integration** – Stream from device camera and capture pavement surfaces
- 🤖 **AI Detection** – Real-time crack detection using a lightweight CNN model with TFLite
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** – Pie chart of crack vs no-crack cases
- 🧾 **Detection History** – Organized list of previous detections with preview & classification
- 🌍 **Location Tagging** – (Coming Soon) Map coordinates of where cracks were detected
- 💾 **Offline Capability** – Image inference runs directly on device (no internet required)
- 🔒 **Admin Panel** – (Coming Soon) Secure admin dashboard to manage users and insights

### 🧱 Tech Stack

| Layer         | Stack                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Frontend      | `Flutter` with `Riverpod`                        |
| AI Model      | `TensorFlow`, trained CNN, exported to `.tflite` |
| Mapping       | `Google Maps SDK`                                |
| State Mgmt    | `Riverpod`                                       |
| Visualization | `fl_chart`                                       |

---

### 📱 Screens & UI

- **Welcome Page**: Displays crack detection pie chart + detection history
- **Camera Page**: Live camera with capture button
- **Map Page**: Location of where previous detection were detected
- **Captured Image Page**: Show captured image, run detection, show bottom sheet result
- **Detection Result**: Beautiful UI with confidence levels, crack status, and visual cues

---

### 🧠 AI Model

- **Model**: Custom-trained CNN for binary classification (Crack / No Crack)
- **Input Size**: `224x224x3`
- **Output**: Single float value (thresholded at 0.5)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow 2.x → TFLite
- **Integration**: Via `tflite_flutter` for Flutter

---

### 🧪 Detection Pipeline

1. Capture image via camera
2. Resize to 224x224 & normalize RGB values
3. Run through TFLite interpreter
4. Display result with confidence level
5. Save result to local history

---

### 🖼️ Sample Code Snippets

#### Camera Initialization

```dart
final cameraAsync = ref.watch(cameraControllerProvider);
```

#### Run TFLite Model

```dart
final interpreter = await Interpreter.fromAsset('assets/cnn_crack_detector.tflite');
interpreter.run(input, output);
```

#### Show Detection Bottom Sheet

```dart
showResultBottomSheet(context, label, confidence);
```
